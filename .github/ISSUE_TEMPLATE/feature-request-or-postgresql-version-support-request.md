# Is your feature request for support for a new PostgreSQL version?

* BDR 1.0 supports PostgreSQL 9.4 with BDR patches, and *only* that version.
* BDR 3.0 supports un-patched PostgreSQL 10 and 11. It is *only available for 2ndQuadrant support customers at this time*. See the [this blog post](https://blog.2ndquadrant.com/news-and-roadmap-for-bdr-multi-master-postgresql/). Watch the [2ndQuadrant blog]() or [planet PostgreSQL](http://planet.postgresql.org/) and [the `pgsql-announce` mailing list](https://www.postgresql.org/list/pgsql-announce/) for updates. Contact info@2ndquadrant.com for details on availability and support options.

**Do not file new issues asking for support for new PostgreSQL versions unless they are merge requests with a patch adding such support**.
