 <para>
  This section gives a quick introduction to &bdr, including setting up a
  sample &bdr; installation and a few simple examples to try.
 </para>

 <para>
  These instructions are not suitable for a production install, as
  they neglect security considerations, proper system administration
  procedure, etc. If you're trying to set up a production &bdr;
  install, read the rest of the &bdr; manual, starting with <xref
  linkend="installation">.
 </para>

 <para>
  For this Quick Start example, we are setting up a two node cluster with two
  PostgreSQL instances on the same server. We are using the terms node and instance
  interchangeably.
 </para>

  <para>
   To try out BDR you'll need to install the BDR extension and the modified
   PostgreSQL release that it requires to run. Then it's necessary to
   <application>initdb</application> new database install(s), edit their
   configuration files to load BDR, and start them up.
  </para>

  <sect1 id="quickstart-installing">
    <title>Installing the patched PostgreSQL binaries</title>
    <para>
    Information about installing &bdr; from packages can be found in <xref linkend="installation-packages"> or installing from source
    can be found in <xref linkend="installation-source">.
    </para>
    <para>
    If you just want to try BDR out quickly and you're on a Linux system (or have a Linux VM to play with),
    you can run a script that'll set up a temporary BDR install in your home directory. <emphasis>
    This installation method is only suitable for trying out BDR, not for production or for use on a
    system with valuable data on it.</emphasis>
    To install the latest stable release, run:
    <screen>
    <prompt>$</prompt> curl -s "http://git.postgresql.org/gitweb/?p=2ndquadrant_bdr.git;a=blob_plain;f=scripts/bdr_quickstart.sh;hb=bdr-plugin/REL0_9_STABLE" | bash
    </screen>
    For the latest development version, instead try
    <screen>
    <prompt>$</prompt> curl -s "http://git.postgresql.org/gitweb/?p=2ndquadrant_bdr.git;a=blob_plain;f=scripts/bdr_quickstart.sh;hb=bdr-plugin/next" | bash
    </screen>
    In either case, when the install finishes, the script prints:
    </para>
    <programlisting>
    ---------------------------
    BDR compiled and installed.

    Sources at /home/myuser/2ndquadrant_bdr/bdr-src
    Installed to /home/myuser/2ndquadrant_bdr/bdr

    Now add it to your PATH:
      export PATH=/home/myuser/2ndquadrant_bdr/bdr/bin:$PATH
    and carry on with the quickstart at https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/BDR_Quick_Start
     ---------------------------
    </programlisting>

    <para>
    To use these new binaries, set your path to point to them. If you used the
    quickstart script, it told you the command to use. If you installed from source,
    add the <literal>bin</literal> directory of your BDR install, e.g.:
    </para>
    <programlisting>
    export PATH=$HOME/2ndquadrant_bdr/bdr/bin:$PATH
    </programlisting>
    <para>
    or, if you installed from RPMs, run:
    </para>
    <programlisting>
    export PATH=/usr/pgsql-9.4/bin:$PATH
    </programlisting>
    <para>
    Note that this only affects the terminal you ran the install from and makes
    no permanent changes. If you wish you can change your path in your
    <filename>.bash_profile</filename>, or just run the export command in
    each terminal you open.
    </para>
  </sect1>

  <sect1 id="quickstart-instances">
    <title>Creating BDR-enabled PostgreSQL nodes/instances</title>
    <para>
     Since we're creating two new PostgreSQL node/instances for this example, run:
     <programlisting>
     mkdir -p $HOME/2ndquadrant_bdr
     initdb -D $HOME/2ndquadrant_bdr/bdr5598 -A trust -U postgres
     initdb -D $HOME/2ndquadrant_bdr/bdr5599 -A trust -U postgres
     </programlisting>
    </para>

    <para>
     Adjust the data directory path (the path after <literal>-D</literal>) if you want
     to use a different location. The rest of these instructions will assume you
     ran exactly the commands given above.
    </para>

    <para>
     These commands do <emphasis>not</emphasis> start BDR, or connect
     the two instances. They just create two independent PostgreSQL
     instances, ready to be configured and started.
    </para>

  </sect1>

  <sect1 id="quickstart-editing">
    <title>Editing the configuration files to enable BDR</title>

    <para>
     Edit the postgresql.conf file for both nodes/instances:
    </para>

    <programlisting>
    shared_preload_libraries = 'bdr'
    wal_level = 'logical'
    track_commit_timestamp = on
    max_connections = 100
    max_wal_senders = 10
    max_replication_slots = 10
    # Make sure there are enough background worker slots for BDR to run
    max_worker_processes = 10

    # These aren't required, but are useful for diagnosing problems
    #log_error_verbosity = verbose
    #log_min_messages = debug1
    #log_line_prefix = 'd=%d p=%p a=%a%q '

    # Useful options for playing with conflicts
    #bdr.default_apply_delay=2000   # milliseconds
    #bdr.log_conflicts_to_table=on
    </programlisting>

    <para>
     Edit or uncomment authentication parameters to allow replication in the
     pg_hba.conf file for both nodes/instances:
    </para>

    <programlisting>
    local   replication   postgres                  trust
    host    replication   postgres     127.0.0.1/32 trust
    host    replication   postgres     ::1/128      trust
    </programlisting>

  </sect1>

  <sect1 id="quickstart-starting">
    <title>Starting the BDR-enabled PostgreSQL nodes/instances</title>

    <para>
     Start your nodes/instances from the command line of your operating system:
    </para>

    <programlisting>
    pg_ctl -l $HOME/2ndquadrant_bdr/bdr5598.log -D $HOME/2ndquadrant_bdr/bdr5598 -o "-p 5598" -w start
    pg_ctl -l $HOME/2ndquadrant_bdr/bdr5599.log -D $HOME/2ndquadrant_bdr/bdr5599 -o "-p 5599" -w start
    </programlisting>

    <para>
     Each node/instance will start up and then will run in the background.  You'll see the following:
     <programlisting>
     waiting for server to start.... done
     server started
     </programlisting>
    </para>

    <para>
     If you see an issue with starting your nodes/instances:
     <programlisting>
     waiting for server to start........ stopped waiting
     pg_ctl: could not start server
     </programlisting>
     ... then take a look at the log files (<filename>bdr5598.log</filename> or
     <filename>bdr5599.log</filename> depending on which one failed to start.)
     Most likely you already have a PostgreSQL instance running on the target
     port. It is also possible that your <literal>$PATH</literal> is not set
     to point to BDR, so you're trying to use binaries from a different PostgreSQL
     release that won't have the <filename>bdr</filename> extension or understand
     some of the configuration parameters.
    </para>

    <note>
     <para>
      Because they were started manually and don't have an init script, these
      nodes/instances won't start automatically on re-boot.
     </para>
