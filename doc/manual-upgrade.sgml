  <title>Upgrading BDR 1.x to BDR 2.x or BDR 3.x </title>

   Contact 2ndQuadrant support for advice on upgrading from BDR 1 to later
   versions.

  <title>Upgrading BDR 0.9.x to 1.0</title>

  <para>
   Upgrading BDR 0.9.x to 1.0 in-place may be done without a full outage
   maintenance window. Each node will need to be restarted, but the restarts
   can be done in a rolling manner to preseve availability.
  </para>

  <para>
   BDR 1.0.7 can join a BDR 0.9.4 group, so upgrades may instead be performed
   by adding new nodes and retiring the old ones. In-place upgrade is generally
   the best option and there's little reason to upgrade this way instead.
  </para>

  <para>
   BDR cannot be downgraded from 1.0.x to a 0.9.x release since the BDR
   extension catalogs have changed. Once one node is upgraded, the node group
   as a whole is committed to the upgrade.
  </para>

  <sect2>
  <title>In-place upgrade</title>

  <para>
   BDR 0.9.x may be upgraded to BDR 1.0.x in-place, by upgrading each node
   one by one.
  </para>
  
  <para>
   It is strongly recommended that all 0.9.x nodes should be first upgraded to
   the latest 0.9.x version then restarted before any are upgraded to 1.0.x.
   You will need to restart the nodes again after the update to 1.0.x, so there
   are two restarts per node in total. The restarts can be rolling, so the node
   group as a whole remains up. Most loads may continue to run on the nodes,
   but DDL should be avoided since the global DDL lock may not be acquired
   while one or more nodes are unreachable.  Avoid attempts to execute DDL if
   at all possible, and try to keep the window during which the nodes have
   different versions short.
  </para>

  <para>
   Before or at the same time as upgrading the BDR plugin to 1.0.x, make sure
   to upgrade postgres-bdr to the latest version. This will be done automatically if
   you've installed BDR from packages. If you're installing from source,
   make sure to install the latest <literal>bdr-pg/REL9_4_STABLE</literal>
   branch (at least as new as tag <literal>bdr-pg/REL9_4_13-1</literal>).
   Downloading and installing the latest bdr-pg tarball will be fine.
  </para>

  <note>
  <para>
   It is <emphasis>not</emphasis> necessary to <literal>ALTER EXTENSION bdr</literal>
   after starting back up. The BDR extension self-upgrades during startup when a new
   version is detected. A PostgreSQL restart <emphasis>must</emphasis> be
   performed; if you attempt to upgrade the extension without a restart BDR
   will not work because the BDR version loaded in
   <literal>shared_preload_libraries</literal> will not match the extension
   schema and catalogs.
  </para>
  </note>

  <para>
   You may install the bdr-patched PostgreSQL and BDR extension updates from source code
   or packages, just like an initial install. You should use the same method you
   used for the intial install; don't try to switch from source code to packages
   or vice versa.
  </para>

  <para>
   No post-upgrade steps are required.
  </para>

  <sect2>
  <title>Upgrade by joining new nodes</title>

  <para>
   You can join new 1.0.x nodes to a 0.9.x cluster, then once all 1.0.x nodes are joined,
   part and retire the 0.9.x nodes.
  </para>

  <para>
   Test this in a QA environment before you do it live, and beware that it's very version
   sensitive. See the BDR 1 release notes for the exact 0.9.x version you need to be
   running for this to work.
  </para>

  <para>
   An in-place upgrade is strongly recommended instead.
  </para>

  <sect2>
   <title>Checking the upgrade</title>

  <para>
   To check that the upgrade has completed successfully, on each node:
   <programlisting>
   SELECT bdr.bdr_version(), (SELECT extversion FROM pg_extension WHERE extname = 'bdr') AS extversion
   </programlisting>
   and confirm that both version numbers shown are 1.0.6. Typical output looks like:
   <programlisting>
   bdr_testdb=# SELECT bdr.bdr_version(), (SELECT extversion FROM pg_extension WHERE extname = 'bdr') AS extversion;
          bdr_version        | extversion 
   --------------------------+------------
    1.0.6-2018-08-01-3b785b4 | 1.0.6.0
   (1 row)
   </programlisting>
  </para>

  </sect2>

 </sect1>

 <sect1>
  <title>Upgrading 0.8.x to 1.0</title>

  <para>
   First, upgrade to 0.9.3, then follow the 0.9.3 to 1.0.0 upgrade steps given above.
   See the manual for 0.9.3 for upgrade steps.
  </para>
