  <title>Upgrading BDR 0.9.x to 1.0</title>

  <para>
   Upgrading BDR 0.9.x to 1.0 may be done without a full outage maintenance
   window. Each node will need to be restarted, but this can be done with
   rolling restarts to preserve system availability. Normal loads may continue
   to run on the nodes, but DDL should be avoided since the global DDL lock
   may not be acquired while one or more nodes are unreachable.
  </para>

  <para>
   BDR 1.0.0 cannot join a BDR 0.9.3 group, so upgrades may not be performed
   by adding new nodes and retiring the old ones. Attempting to join 1.0.x to
   a 0.9.3 node will fail.
  </para>

  <para>
   BDR cannot be downgraded from 1.0.x to a 0.9.x release since the BDR
   extension catalogs have changed.
  </para>

  <para>
   Before or at the same time as upgrading the BDR plugin to 1.0.x, make sure
   to upgrade bdr-pg to at least 9.4.9. This will be done automatically if
   you've installed BDR from packages. If you're installing from source,
   make sure to install the latest <literal>bdr-pg/REL9_4_STABLE</literal>
   branch (at least as new as tag <literal>bdr-pg/REL9_4_9</literal>).
   Downloading and installing the latest bdr-pg tarball will be fine.
  </para>

  <para>
   To upgrade 0.9.x to 1.0.x the extension must be updated and the database
   server restarted. You may complete the upgrade steps on one node before
   starting on the next node or perform the steps in parallel across all nodes
   at once.
   <itemizedlist>
    <listitem><para>If the node is not yet running at least BDR-postgres 9.4.9, install BDR-postgres 9.4.9 or above</para></listitem>
    <listitem><para>Stop the node by shutting down PostgreSQL</para></listitem>
    <listitem><para>Install the BDR 1.0 extension from packages or source code</para></listitem>
    <listitem><para>Start the node by starting PostgreSQL again</para></listitem>
   </itemizedlist>
   It is <emphasis>not</emphasis> necessary to <literal>ALTER EXTENSION bdr</literal>
   after starting back up. The BDR extension self-upgrades during startup when a new
   version is detected. A PostgreSQL restart <emphasis>must</emphasis> be
   performed; if you attempt to upgrade the extension without a restart BDR
   will not work because the BDR version loaded in
   <literal>shared_preload_libraries</literal> will not match the extension
   schema and catalogs.
  </para>

  <para>
   You may install the bdr-patched PostgreSQL and BDR extension updates from source code
   or packages, just like an initial install. You should use the same method you
   used for the intial install; don't try to switch from source code to packages
   or vice versa.
  </para>

  <para>
   No post-upgrade steps are required.
  </para>

  <para>
   To check that the upgrade has completed successfully, on each node:
   <programlisting>
   SELECT bdr.bdr_version(), (SELECT extversion FROM pg_extension WHERE extname = 'bdr') AS extversion
   </programlisting>
   and confirm that both version numbers shown are 1.0.x. Typical output for 1.0.0 looks like:
   <programlisting>
   bdr_testdb=# SELECT bdr.bdr_version(), (SELECT extversion FROM pg_extension WHERE extname = 'bdr') AS extversion;
          bdr_version        | extversion 
   --------------------------+------------
    1.0.0-2016-08-01-3b785b4 | 1.0.0.0
   (1 row)
   </programlisting>
  </para>

  <title>Upgrading 0.8.x to 1.0</title>

  <para>
   First, upgrade to 0.9.3, then follow the 0.9.3 to 1.0.x upgrade steps given above.
   See the manual for 0.9.3 for upgrade steps.
