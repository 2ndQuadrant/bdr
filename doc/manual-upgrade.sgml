  <title>Upgrading BDR 0.9.x to 1.0</title>

  <para>
   Upgrading BDR 0.9.x to 1.0 may be done without a full outage maintenance
   window <emphasis>if the 0.9.x nodes are first all updated to the latest
   0.9.x version and restarted</emphasis>. Each node will need to be restarted, but this can be done with
   rolling restarts to preserve system availability. Normal loads may continue
   to run on the nodes, but DDL should be avoided since the global DDL lock
   may not be acquired while one or more nodes are unreachable.
  </para>

  <para>
   BDR 1.0.7 cannot join a BDR 0.9.4 group, so upgrades may <emphasis>not</emphasis>
   be performed
   by adding new nodes and retiring the old ones. Attempting to join 1.0.7 to
   a 0.9.4 node will fail.
  </para>

  <para>
   BDR cannot be downgraded from 1.0.x to a 0.9.x release since the BDR
   extension catalogs have changed.
  </para>

  <para>
   Before or at the same time as upgrading the BDR plugin to 1.0.x, make sure
   to upgrade postgres-bdr to the latest version. This will be done automatically if
   you've installed BDR from packages. If you're installing from source,
   make sure to install the latest <literal>bdr-pg/REL9_4_STABLE</literal>
   branch (at least as new as tag <literal>bdr-pg/REL9_4_13-1</literal>).
   Downloading and installing the latest bdr-pg tarball will be fine.
  </para>

  <para>
   To upgrade 0.9.4 to 1.0.7 the database
   server must be restarted after new packages are installed. This will automatically update the BDR extension in the system
   catalogs. If you are doing a rolling update where nodes stay online while
   being updated you <emphasis>must</emphasis> update all nodes to the latest
   0.9.x and restart them <emphasis>before</emphasis> updating any to 1.0.x.
  </para>

  <para>
   Update steps for <emphasis>offline update where all nodes are stopped at once</emphasis> are:
   <itemizedlist>
    <listitem><para>Stop every node</para></listitem>
    <listitem><para>If each node is not yet running at least BDR-postgres 9.4.13 install BDR-postgres 9.4.13</para></listitem>
    <listitem><para>Install the BDR 1.0 extension from packages or source code</para></listitem>
    <listitem><para>Start the node by starting PostgreSQL again</para></listitem>
   </itemizedlist>
  </para>

  <para>
   Update steps for rolling update where nodes are updated and restarted one-by-one are:
   <itemizedlist>
    <listitem><para>If each node is not yet running at least BDR-postgres 9.4.13 and bdr 0.9.4, install BDR-postgres 9.4.13 or newer and bdr 0.9.4 or newer and <emphasis>restart the nodes</emphasis>. This can be done one-by-one, but should be done promptly. Do not leave some nodes on a different version of bdr to other nodes for an extended period.</para></listitem>
	<listitem><para>Then, for each node in turn:</para></listitem>
	<listitem><para>Stop the node</para></listitem>
    <listitem><para>Install the BDR 1.0.6 or newer extension from packages or source code</para></listitem>
    <listitem><para>Start the node by starting PostgreSQL again</para></listitem>
   </itemizedlist>
  </para>

  <note>
  <para>
   It is <emphasis>not</emphasis> necessary to <literal>ALTER EXTENSION bdr</literal>
   after starting back up. The BDR extension self-upgrades during startup when a new
   version is detected. A PostgreSQL restart <emphasis>must</emphasis> be
   performed; if you attempt to upgrade the extension without a restart BDR
   will not work because the BDR version loaded in
   <literal>shared_preload_libraries</literal> will not match the extension
   schema and catalogs.
  </para>
  </note>

  <para>
   You may install the bdr-patched PostgreSQL and BDR extension updates from source code
   or packages, just like an initial install. You should use the same method you
   used for the intial install; don't try to switch from source code to packages
   or vice versa.
  </para>

  <para>
   No post-upgrade steps are required.
  </para>

  <para>
   To check that the upgrade has completed successfully, on each node:
   <programlisting>
   SELECT bdr.bdr_version(), (SELECT extversion FROM pg_extension WHERE extname = 'bdr') AS extversion
   </programlisting>
   and confirm that both version numbers shown are 1.0.6. Typical output looks like:
   <programlisting>
   bdr_testdb=# SELECT bdr.bdr_version(), (SELECT extversion FROM pg_extension WHERE extname = 'bdr') AS extversion;
          bdr_version        | extversion 
   --------------------------+------------
    1.0.6-2018-08-01-3b785b4 | 1.0.6.0
   (1 row)
   </programlisting>
  </para>

  <title>Upgrading 0.8.x to 1.0</title>

  <para>
   First, upgrade to 0.9.3, then follow the 0.9.3 to 1.0.0 upgrade steps given above.
   See the manual for 0.9.3 for upgrade steps.
