  <para>
   The <literal>bdr.bdr_nodes</literal> table keeps track of a node's
   membership in a &bdr; group.  A row is inserted or updated in the table
   during the node join process, and during node removal.
  </para>

  <para>
   The 'status' column may have the following values, which are subject to change:
   <itemizedlist>
    <listitem><para><literal>r</literal>- Ready: The node can function fully. Slots may be created on this node and it can participate with the &bdr group.  </para> </listitem>
    <listitem><para><literal>b</literal>- Joining: The node is bootstrapping. This state occurs when join has been initiated but a copy has not yet been begun.</para></listitem>
    <listitem><para><literal>i</literal>- Joining: The node is doing initial slot creation or an initial dump and load</para> </listitem>
    <listitem><para><literal>c</literal>- Joining: The node is catching up to the target node and is not yet ready to participate with the &bdr; group.  </para> </listitem>
    <listitem><para><literal>o</literal>- Joining: The node has caught up with the target node and is waiting for all inbound and outbound slots to be created.  </para> </listitem>
    <listitem><para><literal>k</literal>- Parting/Parted: The node has been 'killed' or removed by the user with the function <literal>bdr.bdr_part_by_node_names</literal>.</para> </listitem>
    <!-- TODO: list incomplete for 0.9 -->
   </itemizedlist>
  </para>

  <para>
   Note that the status doesn't indicate whether the node is actually up right
   now. A node may be shut down, isolated from the network, or crashed and still
   appear as <literal>r</literal> in <literal>bdr.bdr_nodes</literal> because it's
   still conceptually part of the BDR group. Check
   <ulink url="http://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/monitoring-stats.html#PG-STAT-REPLICATION-VIEW">pg_stat_replication</ulink>
   and
   <ulink url="http://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/catalog-pg-replication-slots.html">pg_replication_slots</ulink>
   for the connection and replay status of a node. See <xref linkend="monitoring">.

  <para>
   Performance and conflict statistics are maintained for each node by &bdr; in
   the <literal>bdr.pg_stat_bdr</literal> table. This table is <emphasis>not
   replicated</emphasis> between nodes, so each node has separate stats. Each row
   represents the &bdr; apply statistics for a different peer node.
  </para>

  <para>
   An example listing from this table might look like:
   <programlisting>
   SELECT * FROM bdr.pg_stat_bdr;

 <sect1 id="catalog-bdr-conflict-history" xreflabel="bdr.bdr_conflict_history">
  <title>bdr.bdr_conflict_history</title>

  <para>
   <literal>bdr.bdr_conflict_history</literal> contains an entry for each
   conflict generated in the system while <xref linkend="conflicts-logging">
   is enabled.
  </para>

  <para>
   This history table is <emphasis>not replicated</emphasis> between nodes, so
   each node has separate conflict history records. This is a technical
   limitation that may be lifted in a future release, but it also saves on
   unnecessary replication overhead.
  </para>

  <para>
   It is safe to <literal>TRUNCATE</literal> this table to save disk space.
