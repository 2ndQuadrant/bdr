 <sect1 id="release-1.0.2">
  <title>Release 1.0.2</title>

  <para>
   The BDR 1.0.2 maintenance release fixes an intermittent failure in
   <application>bdr_init_copy</> caused by failure to wait until promotion
   of a copied node has fully completed. (#255).
  </para>

  <para>
   Also fixes failure to replicate the <literal>ch_timeframe</> argument to
   peers when user defined conflict handlers are created.
  </para>

  <para>
   Alongside the bdr-plugin 1.0.2 release, BDR-Postgres is updated to 9.4.10,
   including all fixes and improvements from PostgreSQL 9.4.10. See
   <ulink url="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.4/static/release-9-4-10.html">
   the PostgreSQL 9.4.10 release notes</>.
  </para>
  
 </sect1>

 <sect1 id="release-1.0.1">
  <title>Release 1.0.1</title>

  <para>
   The 1.0.1 maintenance release fixes a significant bug in
   <literal>bdr_group_join</> caused by <literal>bdr_dump</> running parts of
   the binary upgrade code that it shouldn't have. This could lead to incorrect
   frozenxids among other issues.
  </para>

  <para>
   A variety of minor documentation and message fixes are also incorporated; see
   the git log.
  </para>

 <sect1 id="release-1.0.0">
  <title>Release 1.0.0</title>

  <para>
   The 1.0.0 release improves schema change DDL locking, the documentation,
   managment tools, and more. It is <link linkend="upgrade">a straightforward
   upgrade for 0.9.x users</link>, however they should upgrade to bdr-pg 9.4.9
   before upgrading to bdr-plugin 1.0.0.
  </para>

  <para>
   The most important changes are:
   <itemizedlist>
    <listitem><para>improvements to DDL locking to reduce its operational impact by allowing write transactions a grace period before cancellation, blocking new write transactions instead of ERRORing, and allowing many DDL operations to avoid blocking row writes at all</para></listitem>
    <listitem><para>the removal of UDR</para></listitem>
    <listitem><para>a fix for dropped column handling when cloning new nodes via bdr_node_join</para></listitem>
    <listitem><para>global sequence improvements to improve behavior when rapidly consuming sequence values</para></listitem>
   </itemizedlist>
  </para>

  <para>
   There are important compatibility changes in this release. BDR 1.0 removes
   UDR. If you need one-way replication on unpatched community PostgreSQL
   9.4/9.5/9.6, use <ulink url="2ndquadrant.com/pglogical">pglogical</ulink>
   instead. BDR 1.0 is also fully not interoperable with 0.9.x; it cannot join
   a 0.9.x group and 0.9.x cannot join a 1.0 group. However individual nodes
   in the existing 0.9.x cluster can be upgraded to 1.0 one by one, keeping
   the cluster as a whole available during the process.

  <para>
   Version 0.9.1 is a maintenance release focused on stability
   and performance.
  </para>

  <important>
   <para>
    There is a minor incompatible bug fix in this release. The direction of
    replication sets is reversed between nodes whose set memberships differ.
    Previously, if node A was a member of set x, and node B was a member of set
    y, then a table that is part of set x would be replicated from A=>B but not
    B=>A. That is reversed as of BDR 0.9.1 so that nodes receive data on tables
    that are part of their replication sets.

  <para>
   As of 0.9.1 it is now possible for sessions to <literal>SET

   require the global DDL lock to be acquired to instead fail with an ERROR.
   Administrators may choose to set this in <literal>postgresql.conf</literal>
   then have sessions that intend to do DDL override it. See <xref
   linkend="guc-bdr-permit-ddl-locking"> and <xref
   linkend="ddl-replication"> for more information.

  <sect2 id="release-0.9.0-dynconf" xreflabel="Dynamic configuration">
   <title>Dynamic configuration</title>

   <para>
    The biggest change with 0.9.0 is that connections between nodes are now
    configured using the <xref linkend="function-bdr-group-create"> and
    <xref linkend="function-bdr-group-join"> SQL function calls. It is no
    longer necessary to restart any existing nodes when joining a node. Even
    the newly joining node can join without a restart if it was initially
    configured with the settings required for running &bdr; (see
    <xref linkend="settings-prerequisite">).
   </para>

   <para>
    <literal>bdr.connections</literal> is now unused and ignored. If it

   <title>Easy node removal</title>

   <para>
    The new <xref linkend="function-bdr-part-by-node-names"> function allows easy
    online node removal. There is no need to restart nodes or to manually
    delete replication identifiers and slots. Multiple nodes may be
    removed at once.

   <title><application>bdr_init_copy</application> makes its own base backup</title>

   <para>
    <application>bdr_init_copy</application> can now make its own base backup
    of the target node, and does so by default. Its user interface has also
    been overhauled as part of the update to support dynamic configuration.
   </para>

  </sect2>

  <sect2 id="release-0.9.0-docs" xreflabel="Documentation in the source tree">
   <title>Documentation in the source tree</title>

   <para>
    Formal documentation has been written and added to the &bdr; source tree
    to replace the prior ad-hoc wiki based documentation. This allows users
    to more easily refer to documentation specific to their particular
    version and permits the documentation to be updated at the same time
    as the source code.

   <title>Replication sets</title>

   <para>
    Replication sets have been introduced. This new feature allows admins to
    specify sets of tables that each node should receive changes on. It is now
    possible to exclude tables that are not of interest to a particular node, or to
    include only a subset of tables for replication to a node. Replication sets can
    be used for data distribution, for data integration and for limited sharding.

   <title>Global sequence performance improvements</title>

   <para>
    The performance of global sequence voting has been greatly improved,
    especially at higher node counts. It is now less likely for transactions to
    fail because of global sequence exhaustion when the BDR group is under
    significant write load.

   <title>Extension source code separation</title>

   <para>
    The BDR source code has been split into two parts: a set of patches to
    PostgreSQL 9.4 and a separate PostgreSQL extension. This helps streamline
    work on integrating the features BDR requires into core PostgreSQL for
