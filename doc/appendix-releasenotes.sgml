  in the release notes. Please read the release notes for all versions between
  yours and the version to plan to upgrade to before performing an upgrade,

  <title>Release 0.9.1</title>

  <para>
   Version 0.9.1 is a maintenance release focused on stability
   and performance.
  </para>

  <important>
   <para>
    There is a minor incompatible bug fix in this release. The direction of
    replication sets is reversed between nodes whose set memberships differ.
    Previously, if node A was a member of set x, and node B was a member of set
    y, then a table that is part of set x would be replicated from A=>B but not
    B=>A. That is reversed as of BDR 0.9.1 so that nodes receive data on tables
    that are part of their replication sets.
   </para>

  <para>
   Two changes add minor new functionality:
  </para>

  <para>
   As of 0.9.1 it is now possible for sessions to <literal>SET
   bdr.permit_ddl_locking = false</literal> to cause commands that would
   require the global DDL lock to be acquired to instead fail with an ERROR.
   Administrators may choose to set this in <literal>postgresql.conf</literal>
   then have sessions that intend to do DDL override it. See <xref
   linkend="guc-bdr-permit-ddl-locking"> and <xref
   linkend="ddl-replication"> for more information.
  </para>

  <para>
   The new information function <xref linkend="function-bdr-apply-is-paused">
   can be called on a node to determine whether replay from peer nodes is
   paused on that node.
  </para>

  <title>Release 0.9.0</title>

  <para>
   The 0.9.0 release was tagged on Tue Mar 24 2015 as git tag
   <literal>bdr-plugin/0.9.0</literal>. This release requires
   bdr-Pg <literal>bdr-pg/REL9_4_1-1</literal> to support full
   BDR functionality.
  </para>

   <para>
    Development of BDR 0.9.0 was performed by the
    <ulink url="http://2ndquadrant.com">2ndQuadrant</ulink> BDR team.
    Multiple customers contributed funding and other resources to make this
    release possible. 2ndQuadrant continues to fund the ongoing development of
    BDR to meet internal needs and those of customers.

  <sect2 id="release-0.9.0-dynconf" xreflabel="Dynamic configuration">
   <title>Dynamic configuration</title>

   <para>
    The biggest change with 0.9.0 is that connections between nodes are now
    configured using the <xref linkend="function-bdr-group-create"> and
    <xref linkend="function-bdr-group-join"> SQL function calls. It is no
    longer necessary to restart any existing nodes when joining a node. Even
    the newly joining node can join without a restart if it was initially
    configured with the settings required for running &bdr; (see
    <xref linkend="settings-prerequisite">).
   </para>

   <para>
    <literal>bdr.connections</literal> is now unused and ignored. If it
    remains in <filename>postgresql.conf</filename> a warning will be issued
    in the PostgreSQL log on startup.
   </para>

  <sect2 id="release-0.9.0-node-removal" xreflabel="Easy node removal">
   <title>Easy node removal</title>

   <para>
    The new <xref linkend="function-bdr-part-by-node-names"> function allows easy
    online node removal. There is no need to restart nodes or to manually
    delete replication identifiers and slots. Multiple nodes may be
    removed at once.
   </para>

  </sect2>

  <sect2 id="release-0.9.0-init-copy" xreflabel="bdr_init_copy">
   <title><application>bdr_init_copy</application> makes its own base backup</title>

   <para>
    <application>bdr_init_copy</application> can now make its own base backup
    of the target node, and does so by default. Its user interface has also
    been overhauled as part of the update to support dynamic configuration.
   </para>

  </sect2>

  <sect2 id="release-0.9.0-docs" xreflabel="Documentation in the source tree">
   <title>Documentation in the source tree</title>

   <para>
    Formal documentation has been written and added to the &bdr; source tree
    to replace the prior ad-hoc wiki based documentation. This allows users
    to more easily refer to documentation specific to their particular
    version and permits the documentation to be updated at the same time
    as the source code.

  <para>
   The 0.8.0 release was tagged on Fri Feb 6 2015 as git tag
   <literal>bdr-plugin/0.8.0</literal>. This release requires
   bdr-Pg <literal>bdr-pg/REL9_4_1-1</literal> to support full
   BDR functionality.

  <para>
   Upgrading to 0.8.0 from 0.7.x requires a <application>pg_dump</application>
   and <application>pg_restore</application> or
   <application>pg_upgrade</application> because the on-disk format of
   the PostgreSQL database changed between 9.4beta2 and 9.4.0 final.

  </para>

  <sect2 id="release-0.8.0-replication-sets" xreflabel="Replication sets">
   <title>Replication sets</title>

   <para>
    Replication sets have been introduced. This new feature allows admins to
    specify sets of tables that each node should receive changes on. It is now
    possible to exclude tables that are not of interest to a particular node, or to
    include only a subset of tables for replication to a node. Replication sets can
    be used for data distribution, for data integration and for limited sharding.
   </para>

  </sect2>

  <sect2 id="release-0.8.0-global-sequence-performance" xreflabel="Global sequence performance improvements">
   <title>Global sequence performance improvements</title>

   <para>
    The performance of global sequence voting has been greatly improved,
    especially at higher node counts. It is now less likely for transactions to
    fail because of global sequence exhaustion when the BDR group is under
    significant write load.
   </para>

  </sect2>

  <sect2 id="release-0.8.0-ddl-replication" xreflabel="DDL replication improvements">
   <title>DDL Replication improvements</title>

   <para>
    Many more DDL commands can be replicated. Fixes have been applied for
    issues with replicating a few of the previously supported commands.
   </para>

   <para>
    DDL commands that will cause full table rewrites are detected and
    prohibited early.
   </para>

   <para>
    Commands that are disallowed on normal tables are now permitted on temp
    tables, including <literal>CREATE TABLE ... AS SELECT ...</literal>.
   </para>

  </sect2>

  <sect2 id="release-0.8.0-conflict-handling" xreflabel="Conflict handling enhancements">
   <title>Conflict handling enhancements</title>

   <para>
    User defined conflict handlers can now return replacement tuples for
    <literal>UPDATE</literal>/<literal>DELETE</literal> conflicts.
   </para>

   <para>
    User defined conflict handlers are invoked for
    <literal>DELETE</literal>/<literal>DELETE</literal> conflicts.

   <para>
    Spurious conflicts are no longer logged after node initialisation.

  <sect2 id="release-0.8.0-source-split" xreflabel="Extension source code separation">
   <title>Extension source code separation</title>

   <para>
    The BDR source code has been split into two parts: a set of patches to
    PostgreSQL 9.4 and a separate PostgreSQL extension. This helps streamline
    work on integrating the features BDR requires into core PostgreSQL for
    releases 9.5 and onward.
   </para>

   <para>
    The patched PostgreSQL is now tracked in git branches prefixed with
    <filename>bdr-pg/</filename>, mainly
    <filename>bdr-pg/REL9_4_STABLE</filename>.  The extension is now tracked in
    git branches prefixed with <filename>bdr-plugin/</filename>, mainly
    <filename>bdr-plugin/RELX_Y_STABLE</filename> (stable releases)
    and <filename>bdr-plugin/next</filename> (current development tree).
    All branches share the same working repository.
   </para>

   <para>
    Prior releases of the BDR plugin were in the
    <filename>contrib/bdr</filename> subdirectory of the patched PostgreSQL
    source tree instead.
