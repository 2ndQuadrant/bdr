 <para>
  In a asynchronous multimaster environment it can be hard to
  have generated surrogate keys without a chance of
  conflicts. Possible solutions includee using random
  identifiers (like UUIDs) and assigning large ranges of values
  to individual nodes.

 <para>
  &bdr; provides distributed sequences
  as a solution for that problem, without preventing
  implementation of other solutions. These assign small ranges
  of values to individual nodes, which these than can hand out
  during inserts. To make usage of these as simple as possible
  all that has to be done to use these, in comparison to normal
  sequences, is to specify the <literal>USING bdr</literal>
  option when creating a sequence.
