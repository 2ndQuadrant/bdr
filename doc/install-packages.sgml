 <title>Installing &bdr; or &udr; from packages</title>

 <para>
  Installation from packages is a good choice if you want the stable
  release, as it's easier to install and to keep track of your
  installation.
 </para>
 
 <para>
  If you want the very latest BDR or if packages are not
  yet available for your operating system you may instead want to
  <link linkend="installation-source"> install from source
  code</link>.
 </para>

 <note>
  <para>
   These instructions are part of the &bdr; source code so they will be
   outdated if you are looking at documentation for an old &bdr; version.
   Installation from packages will typically install the latest stable
   &bdr; version.

   <title>Install the repository RPMs</title>

   <para>
    To install &bdr; or &udr; from RPMs you should first download and
    install the repository RPM for your distro. This RPM will configure
    the download location for the &bdr;/&udr; packages and load the
    signing key into your RPM database so that the package digital
    signatures may be verified.
   </para>

   <note>
    <para>
     The repository RPM is signed with 2ndQuadrant's master packaging/releases
     signing key. See <xref linkend="appendix-signatures">.

    RHEL and CentOS users should download and install <ulink url="http://packages.2ndquadrant.com/postgresql-bdr94-2ndquadrant/yum-repo-rpms/postgresql-bdr94-2ndquadrant-redhat-1.0-2.noarch.rpm">the RHEL RPM for versions 5, 6, and 7</ulink>, or run:

    Fedora users should download and install the Fedora RPM for Fedora 19 and 20, or run:

    <programlisting>
     # Fedora users only
     sudo yum install http://packages.2ndquadrant.com/postgresql-bdr94-2ndquadrant/yum-repo-rpms/postgresql-bdr94-2ndquadrant-fedora-1.0-2.noarch.rpm

   <para>
    It is strongly recommended that you also enable the
    corresponding repository from
    <ulink url="http://yum.postgresql.org/">yum.postgresql.org</ulink>,
    as the BDR repositories only contain the BDR extension and the
    PostgreSQL server, client, PLs, and the rest of the core
    PostgreSQL release. They do not contain PostGIS, PgBarman, or
    any of the other components already included in
    yum.postgresql.org releases. BDR is fully compatible with these
    components.
   </para>

    Red Hat / CentOS users should also

    </para>

    <para>
     The BDR RPMs cannot co-exist with stock PostgreSQL
     &pgmajorversion;, and BDR does not share the same data directory
     as stock &pgmajorversion;, so it will not be able to read your
     existing databases. (They will not be deleted, and uninstalling
     BDR then reinstalling stock PGDG &pgmajorversion; will get you
     access to them again, but it is strongly recommended that you
     dump them before installing BDR).

     approve the removal if appropriate, and proceed with the removal.
