 <title>Installing &bdr; or &udr; from packages</title>

 <para>
  Installation from packages is a good choice if you want the stable
  release, as it's easier to install and to keep track of your
  installation.
 </para>
 
 <para>
  If you want the very latest BDR or if packages are not
  yet available for your operating system you may instead want to
  <link linkend="installation-source"> install from source
  code</link>.
 </para>

 <note>
  <para>
   These instructions are part of the &bdr; source code so they will be
   outdated if you are looking at documentation for an old &bdr; version.
   Installation from packages will typically install the latest stable
   &bdr; version.
  </para>
 </note>


 <sect1>
  <title>RHEL, Fedora and CentOS</title>

  <para>
   Packages for BDR are available for Red Hat derived distros -
   Fedora, RHEL, and CentOS.
  </para>

  <sect2>
   <title>Install the repository RPMs</title>

   <para>
    To install &bdr; or &udr; from RPMs you should first download and
    install the repository RPM for your distro. This RPM will configure
    the download location for the &bdr;/&udr; packages and load the
    signing key into your RPM database so that the package digital
    signatures may be verified.
   </para>

   <note>
    <title>Verifying the digital signature on the repository RPM</title>
    <para>
     If you wish to verify the repository RPM's digital signature
     using <literal>rpm -V</literal>, the signing key ID is the
     2ndQuadrant packaging key <literal>0x2B11E054</literal>, which
     can be <ulink
     url="https://pgp.mit.edu/pks/lookup?search=0x2B11E054&amp;op=index&amp;exact=on">
     found in the GPG keyservers</ulink>. You can <ulink
     url="http://2ndquadrant.com/signing-keys"> verify the fingerprint
     on the 2ndQuadrant website.</ulink> then import the key with
     <literal>rpmkeys</literal>.
    </para>
   </note>

   <para>
    RHEL and CentOS users should download and install <ulink url="http://packages.2ndquadrant.com/postgresql-bdr94-2ndquadrant/yum-repo-rpms/postgresql-bdr94-2ndquadrant-redhat-1.0-2.noarch.rpm">the RHEL RPM for versions 5, 6, and 7</ulink>, or run:

    <programlisting>
     # RHEL/CentOS users only:
     sudo yum install http://packages.2ndquadrant.com/postgresql-bdr94-2ndquadrant/yum-repo-rpms/postgresql-bdr94-2ndquadrant-redhat-1.0-2.noarch.rpm
    </programlisting>

    Fedora users should download and install the Fedora RPM for Fedora 19 and 20, or run:

    <programlisting>
     # Fedora users only
     sudo yum install http://packages.2ndquadrant.com/postgresql-bdr94-2ndquadrant/yum-repo-rpms/postgresql-bdr94-2ndquadrant-fedora-1.0-2.noarch.rpm
    </programlisting>
   </para>

   <para>
    It is strongly recommended that you also enable the
    corresponding repository from
    <ulink url="http://yum.postgresql.org/">yum.postgresql.org</ulink>,
    as the BDR repositories only contain the BDR extension and the
    PostgreSQL server, client, PLs, and the rest of the core
    PostgreSQL release. They do not contain PostGIS, PgBarman, or
    any of the other components already included in
    yum.postgresql.org releases. BDR is fully compatible with these
    components.
   </para>

   <para>
    Red Hat / CentOS users should also
    <ulink url="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/EPEL">enable EPEL</ulink>.

   <title>Installing PostgreSQL &pgmajorversion; and &bdr; from packages for RHEL, Fedora or CentOS</title>

    <title>Remove the <literal>postgresql94</literal> packages, if installed</title>

    <note>
     <para>If you don't already have PostgreSQL &pgmajorversion; installed, simply skip this step.</para>
    </note>

    <para>
     &bdr; requires a patched version of PostgreSQL &pgmajorversion;
     that conflicts with the official packages from
     yum.postgresql.org. If you already have PostgreSQL
     &pgmajorversion;installed from yum.postgresql.org, you will need
     to make a dump of all your databases, then uninstall the PGDG
     PostgreSQL &pgmajorversion; packages before you can install &bdr;
    </para>

    <para>
     The BDR RPMs cannot co-exist with stock PostgreSQL
     &pgmajorversion;, and BDR does not share the same data directory
     as stock &pgmajorversion;, so it will not be able to read your
     existing databases. (They will not be deleted, and uninstalling
     BDR then reinstalling stock PGDG &pgmajorversion; will get you
     access to them again, but it is strongly recommended that you
     dump them before installing BDR). 
    </para>

    <para>
     Once you have fully backed up all your databases:
     <programlisting>
      yum remove postgresql94\*
     </programlisting>
     Check the list of packages to be removed carefully,
     approve the removal if appropriate, and proceed with the removal.
    </para>

    <para>
     Your data directory for PostgreSQL &pgmajorversion; will still
     exist in <filename>/var/lib/pgsql/&pgmajorversion;</filename> but
     will not be used while BDR is installed.
    </para>

   </sect3>

   <sect3>
    <title>Install the &bdr; packages</title>

    <para>
     To install the &bdr;-enabled PostgreSQL server, &bdr; extension, and the client programs, simply:
     <programlisting>
      yum check-update
      yum install postgresql-bdr94-bdr
     </programlisting>
    </para>

    <note>
     <para>
      If you attempt to to install this package when you already have
      postgresql94 installed from yum.postgresql.org, yum will report
      a conflict refuse to install it.
     </para>
    </note>

    <para>
     Once &bdr; is installed you will need to initdb a new database,
     make any required changes to <filename>postgresql.conf</filename>
     and <filename>pg_hba.conf</filename>, etc, as per any new
     PostgreSQl install. See
     <filename>/usr/share/doc/postgresql-bdr94/README.rpm-dist</filename>
     for details.
    </para>

    <para>
     You can then proceed with BDR-specific configuration per
     <xref linkend="settings"> and <xref linkend="quickstart">.

   <title>Installing &udr; from packages for RHEL, Fedora or CentOS</title>

   <para>
    To install &udr; install PostgreSQL &pgmajorversion; from <ulink
    url="http://yum.postgresql.org/">yum.postgresql.org</ulink> as
    normal. Then install the repository RPMs as outlined above.
    Finally, install the UDR package:
    <programlisting>
     yum install postgresql94-udr
    </programlisting>
