 <title>Installing BDR from packages</title>

 <para>
  Installation from packages is a good choice if you want the stable
  release, as it's easier to install and to keep track of your
  installation.
 </para>
 
 <para>
  If you want the very latest BDR or if packages are not
  yet available for your operating system you may instead want to
  <link linkend="installation-source"> install from source
  code</link>.
 </para>

 <note>
  <para>
   These instructions are part of the BDR source code so they will be
   outdated if you are looking at documentation for an old BDR version.
   Installation from packages will typically install the latest stable
   BDR version.

  <para>
   Packages for BDR are available for Red Hat derived distros -
   Fedora, RHEL, and CentOS. Packages are built for PostgreSQL 9.6+
   from yum.postgresql.org ("PGDG").
  </para>

  <para>
   If you need to install or update BDR on BDR-Postgres 9.4, see <xref

   <para>

    If you do not already have PostgreSQL 9.6 from PGDG, install the

   <title>Install the BDR repository RPM</title>

   <para>
	To install BDR from RPMs you should first download and install the
	repository RPM for your distro. This RPM will configure the download
	location for the BDR packages and load the signing key into your RPM
	database so that the package digital signatures may be verified.
   </para>

   <note>
    <para>
     The repository RPM is signed with 2ndQuadrant's master packaging/releases
     signing key. See <xref linkend="appendix-signatures">.
