  <para>
   BDR runs on unmodified PostgreSQL 9.6 as distributed by the PostgreSQL
   Development Group (PGDG), i.e. postgresql.org. The source code will also
   work with any largely unmodified re-distribution like those by Ubuntu, Red
   Hat, etc, though 2ndQuadrant only provides packages for PGDG releases.
  </para>

  <para>
   BDR is also compatible with BDR-Postgres 9.4, a modified PostgreSQL 9.4 that
   was required by BDR 1.x releases. New installs should use PostgreSQL 9.6.
   Support for BDR-Postgres 9.4 is mainly for existing deployments and for
   upgrades. See <xref linkend="upgrading-bdr-postgres"/> and
   <xref linkend="install-requirements-94">.
  </para>

  <para>
   PostgreSQL 9.5 is not supported and will never be supported. Nor is
   unmodified community PostgreSQL 9.4, or any older version of PostgreSQL.
  </para>

  <para>
   As of the time of writing, Microsoft Windows is not yet a supported
   platform for BDR. Support may be added
   in later releases. If Windows support is important to you, check 
   <ulink url="http://2ndquadrant.com/BDR">BDR website</ulink> for
   the latest information.

   <title>BDR Requirements (BDR-Postgres 9.4)</>

   <para>
    To run on PostgreSQL 9.4, BDR requires a modified PostgreSQL called
    BDR-Postgres 9.4. The modified PostgreSQL adds functionality BDR needs to
    support DDL replication, multi-master conflict resolution, user-defined
    conflict handlers, etc. It is available from the BDR download page
    alongside the extension in both package and source form. This requirement
    means that <emphasis>you can't use BDR on unmodified PostgreSQL
    9.4</emphasis>.
   </para>

   <para>
    Some of these modifications make small changes to PostgreSQL data
    directory. As a result the modified PostgreSQL 9.4 used by BDR can't
    load data directories from unmodified PostgreSQL and vice versa. Users
    must dump and reload their database(s) to switch to a BDR-capable
    PostgreSQL 9.4. See <xref linkend="installation">.
   </para>
   
   <para>
    This is not the case for BDR running on PostgreSQL 9.6, where no modified
    PostgreSQL is required.
