  <title>&bdr; requirements</title>

  <para>
   To use logical replication via &bdr; you will need PostgreSQL 9.4
   or newer. Earlier versions are not supported and will never be supported.
  </para>

  <para>
   Currently &bdr; requires a modified version of PostgreSQL 9.4. This modified
   PostgreSQL adds functionality BDR needs to support DDL replication, multi-master
   last-update-wins conflict resolution, user-defined conflict handlers, etc. This
   modified version of PostgreSQL 9.4 is available from the &bdr; download page
   alongside the extension in both package and source form. This requirement
   means that <emphasis>you can't use &bdr; on unmodified PostgreSQL 9.4</emphasis>.
   <note>
    <simpara>
      All the new features required have been submitted for inclusion in
      PostgreSQL. Many have already been accepted and included. If all the
      functionality &bdr; requires is added to PostgreSQL then the need for
      a modified PostgreSQL will go away in the next version.
    </simpara>
   </note>
   Some of these modifications make small changes to PostgreSQL data
   directory. As a result the modified PostgreSQL 9.4 used by &bdr; can't
   load data directories from unmodified PostgreSQL and vice versa. Users
   must dump and reload their database(s) to switch to a &bdr;-capable
   PostgreSQL. See <xref linkend="installation">.
  </para>

  <para>
   As of the time of writing, PostgreSQL versions after 9.4 are not yet
   supported. Neither is Microsoft Windows. Support for both may be added
   in later releases; please check the
   <ulink url="http://2ndquadrant.com/BDR">&bdr; website</ulink> for
   the latest information.
