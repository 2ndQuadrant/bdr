/*
 * The LWLock API for extensions was changed in c1772ad92 (9.5). We need
 * adapters to allow the new API to be used in code built against 9.4.
 *
 * This is a simplistic adapter that expects one LWLock per tranche and
 * makes no attempt to prevent re-use of tranche names, assignment of
 * locks from unallocated tranches, etc. If the code is right on 9.6
 * it'll work on 9.4 though.
