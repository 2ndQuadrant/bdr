# These instructions are for users who are comfortable compiling from source
# and who know the command line. They're intended for development and testing.
# New users should use the packages, or see the more detailed source install
# instructions in the main documentation.
#
# This package contains both BDR for patched PostgreSQL 9.4 and the reduced
# functionality UDR variant for unmodified PostgreSQL 9.4. UDR is currently
# experimental. These instructions are for compiling full BDR, including the
# patched PostgreSQL. For UDR you may instead put the bin directory of an
# unmodified PostgreSQL 9.4 on the PATH and then invoke ./configure with the
# --enable-udr flag.

# == get dependencies ==
#
# You'll need some extra packages before you can compile PostgreSQL and BDR.
# See the main PostgreSQL documentation for a full list. If you just want to
# try it out quickly for testing this should be sufficient:
#
# For Debian/Ubuntu:
#
#    apt-get install build-essential
#    apt-get build-dep postgresql
#
# Or for Fedora/RHEL:
#
#    yum install yum-utils "Development Tools"
#    yum-builddep postgresql
#


# == get source ==
#
# go to directory where you want to place postgres' and bdr's source code, creating it
# if needed.
$ mkdir -p ~/src/
$ cd ~/src/
# checkout the sourcecode of postgres 9.4 with bdr patches added
$ git clone -b bdr-pg/REL9_4_STABLE git://git.postgresql.org/git/2ndquadrant_bdr.git postgresql-bdr
# checkout the sourcecode of the bdr plugin
$ git clone -b bdr-plugin/next git://git.postgresql.org/git/2ndquadrant_bdr.git bdr-plugin

# ==  build postgres ==
$ cd postgresql-bdr
$ ./configure --enable-depend --enable-debug --enable-cassert CFLAGS="-fno-omit-frame-pointer" --prefix ~/bin/
$ make -j4 -s install-world

# == build bdr plugin ==
$ cd ../bdr-plugin
$ ./autogen.sh
$ PATH=~/bin/bin:$PATH ./configure --enable-bdr
$ make -j4 -s install


# == to update later ==
$ cd ../postgresql-bdr
$ git pull
$ make -j4 -s install-world

$ cd ../bdr-plugin
$ git pull
$ ./autogen.sh
$ PATH=~/bin/bin:$PATH ./configure --enable-bdr
$ make -s install
