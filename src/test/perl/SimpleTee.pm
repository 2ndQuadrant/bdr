# A simple 'tee' implementation, using perl tie.

# Whenever you print to the handle, it gets forwarded to a list of
# handles. The list of output filehandles is passed to the constructor.
#
# This is similar to IO::Tee, but only used for output. Only the PRINT
# method is currently implemented; that's all we need. We don't want to
# depend on IO::Tee just for this.
