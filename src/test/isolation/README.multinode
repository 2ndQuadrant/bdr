    bdr,core: isolationtester: Isolationtester with multi-server support
    
    The spec file can now start with declarations like this:
    
        conninfo "cname1" "port=NNNN dbname=XYZ"
        conninfo "cname2" "port=MMMM dbname=PQR"
    
    And sessions may include connection declarations like this:
    
        session "s1"
        connection "cname1"
    
    Both are optional. If no connection information is explicitly specified,
    then the earlier behaviour (use conninfo from commandline or fall back
    to "dbname=postgres") is retained.
    
    If connection information is specified, we open one "global" connection
    per conninfo (for lock checking) and one connection per session. Setup
    SQL is executed only on conns[0], as before (but perhaps it would help
    to execute it on all until DDL replication is implemented?).
    
    Includes the rudimentary tests from before, including some failing ones.
