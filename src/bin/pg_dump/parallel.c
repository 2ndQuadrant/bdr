/*
 * Parallel operation works like this:
 *
 * The original, master process calls ParallelBackupStart(), which forks off
 * the desired number of worker processes, which each enter WaitForCommands().
 *
 * The master process dispatches an individual work item to one of the worker
 * processes in DispatchJobForTocEntry().  That calls
 * AH->MasterStartParallelItemPtr, a routine of the output format.  This
 * function's arguments are the parents archive handle AH (containing the full
 * catalog information), the TocEntry that the worker should work on and a
 * T_Action value indicating whether this is a backup or a restore task.  The
 * function simply converts the TocEntry assignment into a command string that
 * is then sent over to the worker process. In the simplest case that would be
 * something like "DUMP 1234", with 1234 being the TocEntry id.
 *
 * The worker process receives and decodes the command and passes it to the
 * routine pointed to by AH->WorkerJobDumpPtr or AH->WorkerJobRestorePtr,
 * which are routines of the current archive format.  That routine performs
 * the required action (dump or restore) and returns a malloc'd status string.
 * The status string is passed back to the master where it is interpreted by
 * AH->MasterEndParallelItemPtr, another format-specific routine.  That
 * function can update state or catalog information on the master's side,
 * depending on the reply from the worker process.  In the end it returns a
 * status code, which is 0 for successful execution.
 *
 * Remember that we have forked off the workers only after we have read in
 * the catalog.  That's why our worker processes can also access the catalog
 * information.  (In the Windows case, the workers are threads in the same
 * process.  To avoid problems, they work with cloned copies of the Archive
 * data structure; see RunWorker().)
 *
 * In the master process, the workerStatus field for each worker has one of
 * the following values:
 *		WRKR_IDLE: it's waiting for a command
 *		WRKR_WORKING: it's been sent a command
 *		WRKR_FINISHED: it's returned a result
 *		WRKR_TERMINATED: process ended
 * The FINISHED state indicates that the worker is idle, but we've not yet
 * dealt with the status code it returned from the prior command.
 * ReapWorkerStatus() extracts the unhandled command status value and sets
 * the workerStatus back to WRKR_IDLE.

 * Code for responding to cancel interrupts (SIGINT, control-C, etc)

 *
 * When we get a cancel interrupt, we could just die, but in pg_restore that
 * could leave a SQL command (e.g., CREATE INDEX on a large table) running
 * for a long time.  Instead, we try to send a cancel request and then die.
 * pg_dump probably doesn't really need this, but we might as well use it

 * is safe because PQcancel() is written to make it so.
 *
 * In parallel operation on Unix, each process is responsible for canceling
 * its own connection (this must be so because nobody else has access to it).
 * Furthermore, the master process should attempt to forward its signal to
 * each child.  In simple manual use of pg_dump/pg_restore, forwarding isn't
 * needed because typing control-C at the console would deliver SIGINT to
 * every member of the terminal process group --- but in other scenarios it
 * might be that only the master gets signaled.
 *
 * On Windows, the cancel handler runs in a separate thread, because that's
 * how SetConsoleCtrlHandler works.  We make it stop worker threads, send
 * cancels on all active connections, and then return FALSE, which will allow
 * the process to die.  For safety's sake, we use a critical section to
