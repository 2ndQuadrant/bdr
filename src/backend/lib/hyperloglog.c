 * Portions Copyright (c) 2014, PostgreSQL Global Development Group
 *
 * Based on Hideaki Ohno's C++ implementation.  This is probably not ideally
 * suited to estimating the cardinality of very large sets;  in particular, we
 * have not attempted to further optimize the implementation as described in
 * the Heule, Nunkesser and Hall paper "HyperLogLog in Practice: Algorithmic
 * Engineering of a State of The Art Cardinality Estimation Algorithm".
 *
 * A sparse representation of HyperLogLog state is used, with fixed space
 * overhead.
