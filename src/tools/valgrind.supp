# The libc symbol that implements a particular standard interface is
# implementation-dependent.  For example, strncpy() shows up as "__GI_strncpy"
# on some platforms.  Use wildcards to avoid mentioning such specific names.
# Avoid mentioning functions that are good candidates for inlining,
# particularly single-caller static functions.  Suppressions mentioning them
# would be ineffective at higher optimization levels.


# We have occasion to write raw binary structures to disk or to the network.
# These may contain uninitialized padding bytes.  Since recipients also ignore
# those bytes as padding, this is harmless.

# gcc on ppc64 can generate a four-byte read to fetch the final "char" fields
# of a FormData_pg_cast.  This is valid compiler behavior, because a proper
# FormData_pg_cast has trailing padding.  Tuples we treat as structures omit
# that padding, so Valgrind reports an invalid read.  Practical trouble would
# entail the missing pad bytes falling in a different memory page.  So long as
# the structure is aligned, that will not happen.

# Atomic writes to 64bit atomic vars uses compare/exchange to
# guarantee atomic writes of 64bit variables. pg_atomic_write is used
# during initialization of the atomic variable, hat leads to an
# initial read of the old, undefined, memory value. But that's just to
# make sure the swap works correctly.
